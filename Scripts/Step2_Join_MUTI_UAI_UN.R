# Step 2: Join Species with Urban Tolerance Values
# Authors: Sarah L. Jennings, Emma M. Garrison
##########################################################

# The goal for this script is to join together 3 urban tolerance scores.
# We start by joining UAI and MUTI first, and then join UN in a later set of steps

# The 3 urban tolerance metrics use different naming schemes/taxonomy for identifying species:
# UAI Naming Scheme --> seems to be a combo of eBird and other naming schemes

# MUTI Naming Scheme --> seems to use eBird scheme --> uses eBird 6 letter codes, and AOS species checklist for taxonomic information. 
# There may be a few differences, but for the most part, eBird/Clements naming scheme and AOS agree 

# UN Naming Scheme --> unstated naming scheme for bird species
